/**
 * Contains the class "t3lib_db" containing functions for building SQL queries
 * and mysql wrappers, thus providing a foundational API to all database
 * interaction.
 * This class is instantiated globally as $TYPO3_DB in TYPO3 scripts.
 *
 * TYPO3 "database wrapper" class (new in 3.6.0)
 * This class contains
 * - abstraction functions for executing INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/SELECT queries ("Query execution"; These are REQUIRED for all future connectivity to the database, thus ensuring DBAL compliance!)
 * - functions for building SQL queries (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/SELECT) ("Query building"); These are transitional functions for building SQL queries in a more automated way. Use these to build queries instead of doing it manually in your code!
 * - mysql() wrapper functions; These are transitional functions. By a simple search/replace you should be able to substitute all mysql*() calls with $GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']->sql*() and your application will work out of the box. YOU CANNOT (legally) use any mysql functions not found as wrapper functions in this class!
 * See the Project Coding Guidelines (doc_core_cgl) for more instructions on best-practise
 *
 * This class is not in itself a complete database abstraction layer but can be extended to be a DBAL (by extensions, see "dbal" for example)
 * ALL connectivity to the database in TYPO3 must be done through this class!
 * The points of this class are:
 * - To direct all database calls through this class so it becomes possible to implement DBAL with extensions.
 * - To keep it very easy to use for developers used to MySQL in PHP - and preserve as much performance as possible when TYPO3 is used with MySQL directly...
 * - To create an interface for DBAL implemented by extensions; (Eg. making possible escaping characters, clob/blob handling, reserved words handling)
 * - Benchmarking the DB bottleneck queries will become much easier; Will make it easier to find optimization possibilities.
 *
 * USE:
 * In all TYPO3 scripts the global variable $TYPO3_DB is an instance of this class. Use that.
 * Eg. $GLOBALS['TYPO3_DB']->sql_fetch_assoc()
